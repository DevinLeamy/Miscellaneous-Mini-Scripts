# AddLargeStrings
  This program will take two strings of numbers, however large, and add them together outputing the resulting string.
# PlaceNQueens
  This program will place N queens on a N * N chess board so that the queens are all on safe squares. 
  It will print out all possible boards. <br/>
  Safe Square: A square that is not being attacked by another piece.<br/>

# KnightTours
  Given an N * N chess board this program will output all the possible knight tours starting from the top left corner 
  and the number of tours therein. <br/>
  Knight Tour: When a knight/horse jumps on all squares on a chess board without jumping on a square that has been traveled. <br/>

 # LongestMatrixPath
   Given a matrix of 1's, 1's being path, and 0's, 0's being walls, a start and an end this program will find the longest <br/> path from the start to the end whilst avoiding travelled indexes.<br/>

  # FindASpecialPath
   Given an integer matrix, a start and an end this program will output a path, if there lies a possible path, from the <br/>
   start to the end whilst following the following conditions. <br/> 1: The distance you can travel from a given position is based on the integer value associated with said position. <br/> 2: You cannot travel diagonally. <br/>3: You cannot leave the matrix. <br/>

# FindUniquePaths
  Given a matrix of 1's and 0's, 1's being path and 0's being walls, a start and an end this program with output the number <br/> of ways to reach the end from the start without visiting the same position twice. <br/>

# WhatAreThePossibleStrings
  Given a string of 1's, 0's and ?'s, ?'s being a variable that holds either a 0 or a 1, this program will print all possible strings. <br/>

# FindAllParentheses
  Given a positive integer n this program will output all the possible parenthese couples of length n. <br/>
  Parentheses Couples Ex. () or ()(()) not (() ie. All open parentheses must have a closed parenthese counterpart.  <br/>
